# PREDICTING TRACK SUCCESS ON SPOTIFY USING COVER ART

A picture is said to be worth a thousand words, but does that saying still apply to album art? Before streaming services such as Spotify became the preferred format for music consumption, listeners would peruse the aisles of music stores, scanning the album artwork of CD's and Vinyl Records. During this time, album art likely played a role in whether the album was purchased or not. Our goal is to predict whether this still is true, and if so, determine which album covers are predicted to be most sucessful.

# Business Understanding and Data Understanding

# Modeling and Evaluation

Convolutional Neural Networks were chosen for this analysis, as this model is built to take in images, and allows the computer to "see" and analyze images. 
<!-- What kind of model(s) did you use?
How well did your final model perform, compared to the baseline? -->

# Conclusion
<!-- How would you recommend that your model be used? -->

recs - If album art is important to you, consider launching artists in vinyl, as this has seen a rise in sales, especially among the younger demographic
