# PREDICTING TRACK SUCCESS ON SPOTIFY USING COVER ART

A picture is said to be worth a thousand words, but does that saying still apply to album art? Before streaming services such as Spotify became the preferred format for music consumption, listeners would peruse the aisles of music stores, scanning the album artwork of CD's and Vinyl Records. During this time, album art likely played a role in whether the album was purchased or not. Our goal is to predict whether this still is true, and if so, determine which album covers are predicted to be most sucessful.

# Business Understanding and Data Understanding

# Nowadays, music marketing companies and design services are assuring the world that album art still plays a role in the success of the album and artists' music, but without backing. 

Album art has played an important role in music. It gives visual representation and additional context to the story behind an album. Perhaps most importantly, it helped artists sell music. Before streaming was introducted into the world of music, albums were largely judged by their artwork. Iconic albums such as "Abbey Road" by The Beatles and "Nevermind" by Nirvana have artwork that is still frequently talked about today. 

However, in recent years streaming services such as Spotify have dominated, with streaming making up [80% of revenue](https://toneisland.com/music-industry-statistics/) in the U.S. music industry. Artists and labels have been left wondering if this shift from hard copies to streaming has affected the prominence of albums, and therefore album artwork. [The Playist Effect](https://blog.landr.com/album-art-absolutely-crucial-success-2016/) is a phenomenon that suggests with the rise of streaming, subscribers largest listen to curated auto-play playlists with individual tracks rather an albums as a whole. 

with Spotify being the leader in music streams, it's crucial for record labels to understand the effectiveness of albums and their artwork in this space. 

This analysis will look at tracks from Spotify playlists and their respective artwork to determine which artwork styles are associated with track success. The playsists will be solely from independent artists and labels so no outliers of hugely successful artists are included.

# Modeling and Evaluation

Convolutional Neural Networks were chosen for this analysis, as this model is built to take in images, and allows the computer to "see" and analyze images. 
<!-- What kind of model(s) did you use?
How well did your final model perform, compared to the baseline? -->

# Conclusion
<!-- How would you recommend that your model be used? -->

recs - If album art is important to you, consider launching artists in vinyl, as this has seen a rise in sales, especially among the younger demographic
